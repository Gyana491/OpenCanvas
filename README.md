# Open Canvas

**The Open-source AI creative design Workspace**

Open Canvas is a free, open-source platform that lets you work with AI in a completely visual way. Think of it as your creative workspace where you can connect different AI models, chain them together, and build powerful AI workflows—all without writing a single line of code.

## What Makes Open Canvas Different?

🎨 **Visual & Intuitive**  
Drag, drop, and connect. Build complex AI workflows by simply connecting blocks on a canvas. No coding required.

🔌 **Bring Your Own AI**  
Use any AI model you want—from image generators to language models to video creators. Simply plug in your favorite models and start creating.

🆓 **Truly Free & Open**  
Download it, use it, modify it. Open Canvas belongs to everyone. No subscriptions, no locked features, no limits.

🚀 **Endless Possibilities**  
Create art, generate videos, write content, analyze images, or build something entirely new. The only limit is your imagination.

## Who Is This For?

- **Creators** who want to experiment with AI without learning to code
- **Artists** looking to integrate multiple AI tools into their creative process
- **Hobbyists** who love exploring what AI can do
- **Anyone** curious about AI and wants an easy way to get started
